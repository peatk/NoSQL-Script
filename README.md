# NoSQL Script

#### Background
The analysis aims to provide information to meet the requests of a magazine, "Eat Safe, Love," and involves exploring hygiene scores, RatingValues, and Local Authority areas in the dataset. Throughout the project, I imported data, confirmed database setup, updated the database, and analyzed data using MongoDB queries and Pandas DataFrames.

#### Summary
The NoSQL project involves setting up a MongoDB database named "uk_food" and a collection named "establishments". In the first part, the data from the "establishments.json" file is imported into the database, and the setup is confirmed by listing databases and collections, displaying a document using find_one, and assigning the establishments collection to a variable. Part 2 focuses on updating the database, including adding a new halal restaurant in Greenwich, modifying BusinessTypeID, removing establishments in Dover, and converting certain values to the appropriate data types. The final part, Exploratory Analysis, addresses specific questions related to hygiene scores, RatingValues, and Local Authority areas.
